# pomegranate-env
This repository provides a Conda environment file (pomegranate.yaml) for setting up an environment with Pomegranate 0.14.8, along with compatible versions of Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.  This setup is particularly useful for anyone working with probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian networks, and hidden Markov models using Pomegranate.
